                <td with=33%>  After a recent show in Denver, a young, bearded fan approached David Pajo — Papa M for those of you who have not been keeping track— and offered him some money.<br />“This is for all the music that I’ve downloaded from you.”

                “Keep it,” Pajo replied.<br />

                Not satisfied, the bearded fan opened a bag full of pills— “Well, can I give you some pills or something?”<br />

                “No, man,” Pajo laughed, turning him down. “Really, I do the same thing.”<br />

                As Pajo tells the story at a cafe on Manhattan’s Lower East Side, I laugh. After all, it's a funny story. But it’s also a subtle reminder that the people that make the records are fans too. Pajo is no exception. Our breakfast meeting was supposed to be an interview, but we talked as much about other people’s music as we did about his. At the end of the interview, Pajo apologized sheepishly, “Sorry for rambling. I’m afraid it’s going to be all about the Mekons and Dylan.”

                Just a few years ago the apology would have surprised me. After all, it’s a mighty long toss from Dylan’s Self Portrait to Slint’s</td>

                <b>Why move to New York City?</b><br />

                Just to play music and be around friends. I mostly wanted to get out of Louisville. Of all the friends that I grew up with, there are only a few left there that are still playing music. I’d been there for so long, I just wanted to go somewhere. Every time I come here, the culture is just slammed into your face. There’s always so much going on. I needed some of that; I need a year of that.<br />

                <b>Are you working on Papa M music?</b><br />

                Right now I’m working on stuff that I think is going to be solo stuff, but I don’t know if I’m going to call it Papa M or not. The new stuff sounds so good that I was thinking of doing it under another name, [laughs]<br />

                <b>When you first started using the name, it</b></td>
                <td with=33%>I think I’m getting back into that again. \ I got really into traditional music for a while there, which I’m still into. But trying to write traditional type songs, like verse-chorus type songs, doesn’t really come naturally to me.<br />

                <b>Really?</b><br />

                Yeah, it’s really hard.<br />

                <b>Are you singing on the stuff you’re working on now?</b><br />

                Yeah, there’s a little bit of that. That’s actually the hardest part. The lyrics and all that just drive me insane — it just doesn’t come naturally to me.<br />

                <b>That surprises me. You sing with an almost effortless voice. You make it seem easy!</b><br />

                It’s just hard to get me to do it. I don’t trust my own voice.<br />

                <b>Were you scared the first time you sang on a recording?</b><br />

                Yeah</td>
