        <h2>1.Which parts of recreating the previous page were easy</h2>
            <p>In my opinion, the easiest parts to understand were the hierarchy of the code structure and knowing how to differentiate between the different parts. And also the part about inserting the content of the paragraphs and columns.</p>
        <h2>2.Which parts of recreating the previous page were challenging</h2>
            <p>The parts I found most challenging were especially incorporating images and using different fonts in the same column.</p>
        <h2>3.Which parts of recreating the previous page were not possible</h2>
            <p>All the parts were able to be made, I just had some complications because you have to be very careful that no letters or symbols are missing in the commands so that everything appears correctly, but once everything was checked, it all worked out.</p>
