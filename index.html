    <h1>FANZINE "PUNK PLANET"</h1>
    <h2>Introduction to the fanzine</h2>
    <p align="justify">Founded in 1994 by Dan Sinker, <b>Punk Planet</b> was a Chicago-based zine that redefined the boundaries of the underground. While many of its contemporaries focused strictly on the sonic aspects of the scene, this publication treated punk as a comprehensive DIY philosophy. It prioritized progressive politics, visual arts, and social activism, offering a sophisticated platform for voices often sidelined by the mainstream, including the Riot Grrrl movement and the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
    <p align="justify">The zine was celebrated for its clean, professional aesthetic which contrasted with the traditional "cut-and-paste" look of early punk media, proving that independent journalism could be both gritty and polished. Throughout its 80-issue run, it served as a vital cultural compass until its closure in 2007. Today, it remains a landmark of independent publishing, remembered for its commitment to the idea that being "punk" meant engaging critically with the world rather than just wearing the right leather jacket.</p>
