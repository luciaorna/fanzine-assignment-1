    <h1>FANZINE "PUNK PLANET"</h1>
    <h2>Introduction to the fanzine</h2>
    <p><b>Punk Planet</b> was a 16,000 print run punk zine, based in Chicago, Illinois, that focused most of its energy on looking at punk subculture rather than punk as simply another genre of music to which teenagers listen. In addition to covering music, Punk Planet also covered visual arts and a wide variety of progressive issues — including media criticism, feminism, and labor issues.</p>
